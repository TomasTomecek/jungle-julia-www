# Contributing to this blog

The blog is in Czech and this is in English. Doesn't make sense. But writing in English is easier for me than in my native tongues.

This blog is built using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) engine and [jane](https://github.com/xianmin/hugo-theme-jane) theme.


## Preview local changes in a browser

Run this command in terminal:
```
$ hugo server -wD
```

It will watch for changes and interpret them in real time.


## Writing articles

All articles are stored in [`content/post/`](/content/post/). The text using the [markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) syntax.
